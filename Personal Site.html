	<p>About two years ago, I decided to enroll in Lord Fairfax Community College 
	to pursue software development. I choose this path because I love coding. I 
	remember the first time I ran my code. It was so exciting to be able to see 
	what I was able to create. I'm looking to continue having that same thrill.</p> 

	<p>I can be calm person at times, but I'm always up for trying something new in 
	my life. I believe that I'm able to grow as a person and become more well-rounded. 
	Other than trying new things, I want to help others in any way that I can. I feel 
	that software development is a great way to do so. The reason being is that you're 
	able to create programs that could aid people in learning or performing difficult 
	tasks.
	</p>
	
	<p>When it comes to my hobbies, I love to watch read and television. I 
	haven't done much reading since I was in high school, but I would like to start 
	up again. I enjoy reading any book that takes me out reality and introduces me to 
	a new world. The same could be said of television. </p>
